# audio_task

Actually, I'm not that kind of person who is good at explaning codes, programs, whatever(Screw me!ðŸ˜‚). But anyways I'll do my best for describing what I made.

## 1. voice_recorder.py

## 2. ac_utils.py

* Install 'wave' before you use this. (command: pip install wave)
* You need 'ffmpeg' also for using this. (Search google and install it appropriately according to your OS)
* And this file is set of functions so only existence of the file is enough.

## 3. audioconverter.py
